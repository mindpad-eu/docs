mindpad is a note-taking app built around one idea: your notes are yours alone.

## How it works

When you write a note, mindpad encrypts it on your device before it ever leaves. Not "encrypted in transit" or "encrypted at rest" — encrypted before it syncs, using [OpenPGP.js](https://openpgpjs.org/). By the time your note reaches our servers, we can't read it. Nobody can, except you.

## The trade-off

Real privacy comes at a cost. If you lose your encryption key, you lose your notes. There is no recovery option, no support ticket that can help, no backdoor. This is not a limitation we're working to fix — it's the point.

We think that's a fair trade for knowing your thoughts are truly private.

## Built in Europe

mindpad is built and hosted entirely within the European Union, under GDPR — some of the world's strongest data protection laws. No tracking. No ads. No AI training on your content.

## Why mindpad?

Most note-taking apps are built around convenience. Sync everywhere, search everything, share with anyone. Privacy is an afterthought, if it's considered at all.

mindpad makes the opposite trade-off. It's writing-first, calm, and honest about what it can and can't do. It won't have every feature. It will always protect your notes.
